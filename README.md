# Hangman

Python implementation of hangman with the aim to compare different strategies for the game.  
To implement a new strategy, implement a new subclass of the *Player* class. It can then be
used in the *Comparator* to compare it to other strategies.

*hangman.py* is the main script.

Use *word_extractor.py* to refine the list of words you wish to be included in the game.
